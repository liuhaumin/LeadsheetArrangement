# Abstract

Research on automatic music generation has seen great progress due to the 
development of deep neural networks. However, the generation of 
multi-instrument music of arbitrary genres still remains a challenge. 
Existing research either works on lead sheets or multi-track piano-rolls
found in MIDIs, but both musical notations have their limits. 
In this work, we propose a new task called lead sheet arrangement
to avoid such limits. A new recurrent convolutional generative model for the task
is proposed, along with three new symbolic-domain harmonic features to facilitate
learning from unpaired lead sheets and MIDIs. Our model can generate 
lead sheets and their arrangements of eight-bar long.
